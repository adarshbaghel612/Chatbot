# Chatbot
This repository contains a full implementation of a memory-enabled conversational chatbot powered by a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) (Gemma 3-270m-it).  The core feature is the ability to maintain long-term dialogue coherence by managing and feeding the entire conversation history back to the model on every turn.
